### **1. 项目说明**

[CAP5415-Computer Vision (FALL 2016)](http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~bagci/teaching/computervision16.html)课程的学习笔记

### **2. 课程简要介绍**

**COURSE GOALS:** The course is introductory level computer vision course, suitable for graduate students. It will cover the basic topics of computer vision, and introduce some fundamental approaches for computer vision research:

 - Image Filtering, Edge Detection, Interest Point Detectors
 -  Motion and Optical Flow
 - Object Detection and Tracking
 - Region/Boundary Segmentation
 - Shape Analysis and Statistical Shape Models
 - Deep Learning for Computer Vision
 - Imaging Geometry, Camera Modeling and Calibration

**PRE-REQUEST:** Basic Probability/Statistics, a good working knowledge of any programming language (python, matlab, C/C++, or Java), Linear algebra, Vector calculus.

**GRADING:** Assignments and the term project should include explanatory/clear comments as well as a short report describing the approach, detailed analysis, and discussion/conclusion.
3 Programming assignments 45% (15% each)
Term project 35%
Mid-Term Exam 20%
(tentative date: 15 November 2016, in-class, written)
